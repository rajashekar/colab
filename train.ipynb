            "rule there is of no curiosity the june biggest and back and for this was chosen for a couple of reason in of the release of the new star trek not sure is the right reason a bit of insanity to ease me everyone back into that regular i had some freaky lined but it nearly broke my me sick when i tried to write it up as a so going for this which is admittedly not an attractive set of mental but more than this me want to scoop out my own brain with a salad reason on with the the biggest stick mudd on but is ceti alpha v big enough for both of these paramount star this is not for just for if harry you an report him to the proper the title biggest should give you one or two about what may unfold in this but unless thinking then a little off the let me enlighten khan sat at his waiting for his to he ran his over the rich leather of the as he reflected on the last eighteen made great progress here on ceti alpha despite its harsh but he would never admit this to he would not let them grow soft and complacent he always and he certainly would not allow to interfere in their whoever was on the ship that had just landed must be dealt this intruder to be none other he rising to his and seizing it pleasure to make your khan khan his hand free with am ruler of this entire i once had a planet of me rather mundane chat during which mudd how he was on a planet with sexy until kirk came along and them so that no longer give him much as a single hand sad times for me get this you had a planet full of how what were harry never for it in his they just they were my loyal who follow their not real people need a true leader to command people do my bidding because they fear they respect up your what of who is to rule over your planet when you are seeing as how i a bit of a moot he at i be a bit if there was more than one harry running around the are a little and your name you i doubt if you have ever let alone satisfied a woman in your ho he just had to go he pretty that any sexual challenge is not taken lightly by harry harry undid his belt and you he his pants and a garish pair of down to his he his belly and a look at and tell me not his flaccid penis hung below his ample but there was no that even in its dormant condition it was of substantial i can safely say i have never met a man when out his khan a horrifically inappropriate khan at have the penis of a inappropriate on a few because of what between khan and said later in the undoing his pants and pushing them he revealed his own is a harry squinted i not nearly as big as it is every smaller by an at why did never get like this in the actual an i find your order highly clearly so hop to suspect your human may be because your observation is down put your penis away just embarrassing a not a an shaft that a you think yours would be bigger than mine when harry as he himself to as declared stroking his own if you win the argument by simply revealing your the next logical step is to masturbate both men stood in front of each pants around their raging pointing angrily at each just the door from an adjoining room and stepped would you like me her gaze landed on rigid then her khan turned five of red in anger and he and beat a hasty the little harry absently stroking his rather sure you satisfy her just course i satisfy her and many look how much mine is than mine is bigger by several they get in and just i see how this argument can continue one of the two will be the and the other person is just lying or physical size really open to debate or maybe just fetch a the fact that thinking about the logistics of this must mean that finally warped my redness even telling but as he harry stepped and the tip of his poked khan just below his looking both could plainly see that phallus did not even touch coming up several khan suddenly you if i were i think be less and people in their with our erect penis are we back as that in one of the ways you could possibly be start yours is plenty big just not in the same league as khan was not ready to give does not satisfy a it i can outlast any man on this just yourself already standing in front of a man whose penis is much bigger than yours trying to tell him that i know he you just let it drop and walk away whilst you still have a shred of dignity such harry at him really want to know how you know you afraid of my course but beaten you twice why should i want to bother what do i get if i do you to go of and some if i you are my prisoner khan slowly stroking his the bit relatively threatening until the his now it like just after a wait a could that sucker all no do you do each a look of shock swept across face as harry wrapped his around his he fearfully at massive it never one to khan dick like a soldier up a only he was not a he was and it was not a it was a harry took long along rigid he his hand into the wiry black mass at the base of shaft and tightly as he drew his hand along its over the veiny to the massive purple occasionally harry mixed it up by the shaft and gently but firmly squeezing and tugging on the fuzzy sack khan also worked squeezing and they both worked completely by sense of each set of locked on the in harry sensed the tempo of increasing and thought it might reflect own impending in a moment of khan closed his and his head and harry knew that he had most of had stopped just short of the head of with his next few he dragged his hand completely across the head and even added a little twist at the bucked and he as jet after jet of white fluid was across the squeezing the last from harry a randy little honor our agreement like a i khan gave harry another sharp this bastard was constantly finding new ways to antagonize am a man of my he made as if to pull up his pants and hold on just a just when khan thought there was no lower level of humiliation to sink harry his cock in front of you have some unfinished business to take care khan took hold of cock none too gently and working it no longer holding harry himself to enjoy it this he put both behind his head and closed his as he bucked his back and thrusting his cock in and out of he in short he too to see the first shot land across his khan dick toward the only once eruption had ended did khan feel that he could safely release i say i relish the fact that my name is among those at shooting across the room and up onto his just be glad it do any more pretty dangerous to they both had their pants securely about their once harry continued talking a mile a have you ever thought of going into got the in outer khan had him by the throat with lightening quick and of your you pompous or i shall most assuredly tear it out and feed it to you will never speak of this to under pain of i honestly feared harry was breaking into song luckily it was just khan finally have to choke a hate to say but if just gone with the choking and death in the first have saved himself one hell of an embarrassing more course of course khan and harry rubbed his choking and just point me to my and be out of your hair khan a button on his a moment the young man he wrinkled his and his went immediately to the on the gotten used to khan cursed himself for forgetting about the stink he and mudd had mudd with a worth of no then escort him to his and see that he doing business with harry his but khan only at him as he the harry out behind remember what me dear old pappy used to walk and carry a big his down the corridor as he like a perverted in the and the moral of this the best way to solve an argument is by getting out your just be sure yours is bigger than your or masturbation might biggest by posted at am film star trek series a finally back by popular for you not quite sure going on in the facial in that but i feel it perfectly the about to show i you is a slash what really me most about this is who the bloody there is a whole community on devoted to of gay if surely the height of blasphemy to about bumming if that man is the one who goes on to betray him to his why would you be interested in or in the first place if not a mystery to people are i picked one from the many to share this one is by the imaginatively a member of the i like opening very are i am with a double capital you know going to be a good one when the rating is with some very pornographic and graphic in general graphic and i didnt write the somehow i get the feeling the whole faith is their god for this very on with the plot we kick off with a little to try and convince you a story behind the there basically into an old house to shag fun times are had by stood behind the closed door staring at who was leaning against the cracked wall across the was worried because the rabbi had the other to wait with at her house and he had led on a silent walk to this abandoned old house in the of it was a million that was in a small waist wrap and nearly broken the and sweat from their long hair and glistening on their toned and fit from the bit about the glistening goatee sweat is a bit of a of how mistaken this writer is about the kind of imagery they believe is attractive in sex also like to point out that you should be me for breaking this up into all one continuous paragraph in the original of it even more of a joy to was breathing heavily and his heart was beating as the good teacher his cheek in his hand and went in to kiss him in friendship as he had done many however this felt his smooth and soft tongue pass between his quivering and engage the future traitor in a real which he and it to last an and was disappointed when finally removed him mouth from the apostle and then to explore his sweaty feeling every inch of visible making the cock grow and twitch beneath the linen and from his trembling i love it when try to use every possible alternative for a character in an attempt to avoid the same name over and over the only purpose that substituting for and for is giving the even honestly find it less and weird it if they just went with the actual name and repeated it a few times rather than scraping the bottom of the and bizarre te rabbi then set down and to undue the with undue enthusiasm and though of saying something but was in to much awe and to mention sexual he kept this is a bit i am pretty best just shut watched as the trail of hair descending from the navel faded into a thick bush which in it a the good rabbi slowly himself until his soft the tip of the and his tongue a circle around the edge before descending the shaft and up the sending into of as accepted the rod down to the back of his he traveled back again his agile tongue around the salty brim before going again to the hairy base making buck his and press into the long from the erection and slowly removed his own a large veined erection by black ah this would be where the attractive imagery i comes into at its sight and rubbed his own trying to relieve some of the but the gentle hand that removed it and raised the onto his slid one long finger down before pressure to the quivering then finally penetrating it and slowly his digit to be by his i did go to church as a and pretty sure was to as gentle hand that i always it meant that his was the gentle hand that us about our day to day rather than the hand that our up onto his so he can love us in the oh those just took on some frightening new and against the finger until another one deep inside of the boy and slowly the and again added a and with a grand total of three he to and relax grand not a bloody game a total of three you now have up won the speedboat and the the future traitor and bucked his his large erection spewing salty out onto his mass of black removed all three and then his own massive and head at the ready opening and applied am i missing something or is this just hideously unattractive sex and no let out a muffled scream of pleasure and pain as the sword of plummeted into his sword of are they clearly been watching the right for him with sharp pain and dull his rolling back into his head he out bucking against the large cock and begging for more from his lord and above and more and harder and harder against the pressing it to its and then he felt his tighten and he removed his cock and cum over it with the as he let out stream after stream of to my list of that need to be out more often during along with of cum spewing out of large cock and with to the list of that i will be weeping over and wishing i could erase from my mind for many to he breathed hard and then down at cum covered which had not yet experienced and lay on his back and elevated his showing what he was understood perfectly and mounted the a finger before the but him and him square in the showing what he and without any preparation he let out a harsh scream and his cock as hard as he could towards virgin the and virgin are all i probably could have lived without never the savior in agony and sadistic pleasure as the cock forced open the tight fleshy hole making blood trickle down shaft and sending of felling over both this is sending some of felling over me right and it really fell too at forced the cock in and that holy filling it to the brim with was grunting and was moaning and sometimes screaming at the sharp of finally and filled entrails with jet after jet of white juice into the virgin body of he onto his body heaving and his heart pounding out of his as his cock went limp and slid from the entrance of the they slept that way till dawn and the silent walk back to i even know where to full of entrails filled with white oh for the imagery in this the sound utterly tasteful in by posted at am book childhood why oh a this one is short and not at all just going to post the whole i read this in a kind of wondering if i should be laughing or the answer i at was in a twisted this is actually in is some when the scarecrow spontaneous sexual if only wizard of r for the the quite like to know what the hell version of the movie this been the straight in there with the the obviously not even going to bother a plot behind a the sound off the of her she rubbed her clit but her forward into her causing her to be even but the one great thing about the they were either so far away from everything or sound so no one could hear left guessing what assuming to the writer just to get straight on with the scarecrow and part of the fun was being vocal about considering on the farm she had to be as quiet as a church quickly over her but her own movement against her hand to moan loudly again as her met the we even get any explanation as to why the scarecrow suddenly up over her which i for one would find more than a tad but it phase at without a or her needing to persuade he came over between her and her was to feel his cloth mouth feeling rather erotic on her making her even more wet than she was before he she her against his straw and even that felt she up at him with want you inside do he said pointing down to where there was nothing but straw and how thick is what does she for him to produce some kind of straw erection to stick in i see that working luckily for he the humiliation of not being able to perform in that because he another trick up his i can do and with that his face went down her body until his cloth met her she involuntarily at the his warm wet cloth tongue met her and she was she was grinding against yelling out some and soon enough was left limp and after a while she brought him back up to her face and him only the back in could do erotic the scarecrow being unable to get it that thing is rather but i did a healthy mix between and is always probably that i never was a huge fan of the wizard of whilst growing so reading this involve the destruction of too many happy childhood but sure it will have been highly disturbing for those of you for whom it was a childhood on another i believe is as an exclamation of it should definitely be used more i wonder if any with the tin man leave you with that by posted at am no film musical childhood wizard of older home subscribe hello and welcome to my i have made it my mission to find the
